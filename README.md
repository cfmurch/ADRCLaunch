## Publishing

The page can be published to Posit Connect by opening `launch_page.Rmd` and pressing the blue button in the top right. Only the rendered document, not the source code, should be published.

A short url should be created from within Connect. On the right hand settings panel, enter a name under "Content URL".

## Editing

The sidebar links and the main text can be edited within the `launch_page.Rmd`. There are html comments denoting the correct places to edit.
